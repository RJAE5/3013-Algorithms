## 03-19-2025 Tries (Worksheet)

Tries are not trees (but kind of are). They are prefix trees, used for autocomplete, spell checking, etc. 

The node has a bool basically saying it's a complete word. A path is unique, and on the worksheet, this is visualized in the worksheet by each pointer only pointing to one letter out of the entire block for each new node.
