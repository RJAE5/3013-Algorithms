## Graph Coloring and Graph Bipartiteness

### Bipartite
Means you can divide a graph into two sets, and all the edges go across the cut, and none of the nodes on either side of the graph are connected.

Basically, you can color each pair of adjacent nodes with exactly 2 colors ensuring none of the same colored nodes are touching. This makes it visually easier to split it into the two distinct sets to verify that the graph is indeed bipartite.

A cycle of odd length prevents a graph from being bipartite. We also covered the "Place the Guards" problem, which was interesting.
